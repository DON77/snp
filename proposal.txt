Dear Sir/Madam,  

 I'm a professional enthusiast with practical experience for more than 8 years. I have all necessary skills to create web based apps from scratch, as well as taking care of the code that has already been written. I'm very self-motivated individual who are working to bring success to the client, as I believe that each person must be proud of what he has done. Here's a couple of my projects I'm proud of:  
naregatsi.org 
onestopforyou.com  
smartproperty.com  
ldc.am  agfuse.com  
Also there're more that unfortunately can't be introduced, as of signed NDA and closed systems. But I'll be able to tell more about them in case of your interest.	 
I'm a responsible person, with strong conviction, that each start of new job is a start of new relationship, which can and must go on getting stronger each moment. That's why accepting and respecting the deadlines are mandatory for me, also I'm not only doing implementation of your ideas, I'm trying to bring best solutions to each part of application, and as a fact all my clients are satisfied with their end product. 
Thanks for your time and hope to read you soon.   

Regards,
 Armen.
